[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/fsolares/R-Credit_Risk_Analysis/master)

This is a credit risk analysis using two different machine learning models: Boosted Decision Tree and Boosted Logistic Regression. The main goal is to identify the possibility of a loss resulting from a borrower’s failure to repay a loan or meet contractual obligations.

## Important Sources

For this project, we’re going to use the famous German Credit Data Set, already cleaned and organized (new column names and target variable in the first position). You can find the original data set at: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data) and the cleaned one in this repository.
